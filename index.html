				In 2011, Libya woke up from a 42 year dictatorship which began in 1969 when Muammar Gaddafi overthrew King Idris. Afterwards, he installed the Jamahiriya system that had been said to be an alternative to the deceiving communism and capitalism which is all explained in the ‘Green Book’. The book, written and published by Gaddafi, was mandatory to have in every home of Libya because it contained the official program of his regime; in fact it was used as propaganda of his thoughts imposed over the whole country. The strict Gaddafi regime started to crumble when Fethi Tarbel, a human rights activist, was arrested on the 15 February of 2011. Many demonstrators assembled at Benghazi on February 15th and 16th of 2011. Later on that week, even though it was announced that Tarbel would be released, in Tripoli, El-Beida, Zintan and Benghazi the demonstrations continued. On the third day, February 17th, Gaddafi violently answered by mobilising his followers and causing many clashes between Gaddafi’s followers and the ‘rebels’. In Benghazi, the clashes resulted with seven deaths. The civil war then started and lasted six months, Gaddafi died on October 20th 2011 when the rebels got to his hideout and killed him. That civil war resulted in more than 30 000 deaths and 4000 disappearances for a population of over 6 million. The rebels have managed to establish a democratic state and rebuilt the economy of the country and yet, to get to that they had to endure severe and violent oppression in the form of warplane attacks and communication interruption commanded by Gaddafi in order to create fear among the rebels and to cut the amount of information they receive.

				In January 2015, the Democratic Republic of the Congo lived many demonstrations against the President Joseph Kabila; the president wanted to pass a change to the electoral code which would have taken years following the legal procedure by doing a referendum. Joseph Kabila had inherited the power after his father, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, was assassinated in 2001; five years later, he was legally elected as the President on the first free democratic election of the country. Later on, he was re-elected in 2011, it would have been his second and last presidency term. By ‘proposing’ these changes to the electoral code, the next presidential elections should be delayed and his term should be lengthened. The population was displeased as the Senate was already studying the proposition. Four days of violent protests followed in mid-January 2015, and numerous clashes between the security forces and the demonstrators occurred, leaving a total of 40 people killed by the security forces. Eventually, the Senate pushed over the proposition and voted ‘unanimously’ to remove any procedure to change the electoral code, which allowed the elections to take place as expected on Mars 20th, 2016.

				Toronto, the biggest city of Canada hosted in 2010 the G20 conference. As usual, many protesters went into the streets with the hope of being heard by the twenty most powerful countries of the world. The Toronto police department had consequently prepared itself to prevent any threats towards the event. They had installed a fence surrounding G20 conference site and required the identification of anyone near the fence. On June 26th 2010, the protesters were peacefully chanting slogans for change, expressing their opinions; among them people from other countries that came to have their voice heard. Later on that evening, a group of people clothed on black created violence and chaos. These people, called the ‘Black Block’ broke shop windows, torched vehicles, among other things. They ended their disastrous course at the Queen Elizabeth Park where they took off their black clothes and anonymously mixed with the rest of the crowd. Meanwhile,  police officers started a massive arrest of  demonstrators by circling little groups and violently assaulting random people. The police also used rubber bullets, smoke bombs, as they were riding horses and bicycles to contain the masses. Even when the protesters only sat down peacefully, the officers arrested them using force.  
				The great number of people arrested was brought to the old Toronto Film Studios which became a  ‘makeshift prison’. 
				According to the testimonies taken after almost a day of imprisonment, the demonstrators in custody had not been allowed to call anyone, they had little water and food, they were in small cages and segregation was made depending on their sexual orientation. There were also cases of sexual assault during the arrest of some women. Fortunately, enough information was released and many of the injustices have been punished since. Still, it is very concerning to see this happening in a country like Canada.

			Mexico, September 2014, many were found dead after a clash between the police of Iguala and the students of Raúl Isidro Burgos school. The students were heading from Ayotzinapa, Guerrero to Iguala where a demonstration against the changes to the professor’s  work status was going to be held. On their way, police officers intercepted the five buses and arrested all the persons in two of the buses from which, forty-three students were reported missing. The police officers also gun shotted one of the buses. In the end many students died and to this day, the forty-three students arrested have not been found.
			Divers demonstrations have been held in many states of the country, and many universities have been active to press the government to search for the missing students. Although during these protests there wasn’t any violence from the authorities, the investigation has proved that the Iguala mayor, José Luis Abarca Velázquez, had ordered the attacks and arrests, and handed the students to a narco gang called the ‘Guerreros Unidos’. Weeks later, the authorities found forty-three bodies which were calcined. The Mexican authorities claimed that those were the remains of the missing students but in October 7th, the UN investigators said that the analysis proved that none of the bodies were from the forty-three Ayotzinapa students. The bodies were probably from other violent disappearances, a frequent occurrence all over the country.  In October 17th 2015, the leader of the gang was captured and declared that they had tortured, killed and dumped the bodies in a mass grave.  
			The demonstrations continued to press the President, Enrique Peña Nieto to step down and to leave the presidential post to another person. The protests haven’t worked and the forty-three students are still missing to this day.

			Even if there’s still a long way to go and there are still states countries that may not respect the right of free expression, in some countries like Guatemala, the demonstrations worked just right. In a country that had suffered great oppression during the civil war (1960-1996) where at least 245 000 people disappeared or died,  and that still encounters various social problems, many voices rose up in 2015 demanding the resignation of the President, Otto Pérez Molina, after the exposure of a multimillion-dollar corruption scandal. To accomplish this, a gathering was organised every Saturday for nearly two months where thousands of protesters assembled to stop corruption. The crowd gathered everyone: students, workers, businessmen, priests, house wives, etc. which is very impressive given the fact that everyone and every social class has different opinions. The trial was supervised by the UN since the judicial system in Guatemala is too weak. 
			Finally, the president resigned, in September 3rd 2015, and all ended without any casualties or injustices of any type.

			<p> Violence, injustice, corruption, war, death, chants, crowds, voices. How frequently do we need to hear this on the news? How many times do we need to see violence? When are we going to realize that WE have the power to change something? We are the people, we are the ones who give power to the ones who might oppress us if we let them. We aren’t puppets or “expectators” of our lives. We are the leaders, the actors.  “The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; [...]”, and to kill, to oppress, to dictate, should not be the basis of our authority’s actions. The authority should protect us and our will. Here I spoke about only a few cases when there are countless others all around the world because I want to change something, and here is my opinion. What will you do to revendicate your rights, your freedom and your power?   </p>
