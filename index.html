			<p> ‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and  expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.’ are the words used in the 19th article of The Universal Declaration of Humans Rights as stated by the UN on 10 December 1948. Theoretically, this declaration applies to each and every country of the world and more importantly, allows, individuals, to express our opinion without fearing any trouble, violence or punishment. This ‘in theory’, in practice, we still have a long way to go.

				In 2011, Libya woke up from a 42 year dictatorship which began in 1969 when Muammar Gaddafi overthrew King Idris. Afterwards, he installed the Jamahiriya* system that had been said to be an alternative to the deceiving communism and capitalism which is all explained in the ‘Green Book’. The book, written and published by Gaddafi, was mandatory to have in every home of Libya because it contained the information of his regime, plus, was used as propaganda of his thoughts over the whole country. 
				The Gaddafi’s regime started to crumble when Fethi Tarbel, a human rights activist, was arrested on the 15 February of 2011. Many demonstrators assembled at Benghazi on February 15th and 16th of 2011. Later on that week, even though it was announced that Tarbel would be released, in Tripoli, El-Beida, Zintan and Benghazi the demonstrations continued. On the third day, February 17th, Gaddafi violently answered by mobilising his followers and causing many clashes between Gaddafi followers and the ‘rebels’. In Benghazi, the clashes resulted with 7 deaths. The civil war then started and lasted 6 months when Gaddafi died on October 20th 2011 when the rebels got to his hideout and killed him. That civil war resulted in more than 30 000 deaths and 4000 disappearances which were counted of a population of over 6 million.
				The rebels managed to establish a democratic state and rebuilt the economy of the country and yet, to get to that they had to endure severe and violent oppression in the form of warplane attacks and communication interruption.

				In January 2015, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had many demonstrations against the President Joseph Kabila; the president wanted to pass a change to the electoral code which would have taken years following the legal procedure by doing a referendum. Joseph Kabila inherited the power after his father, Laurent-Désiré Kabila was assassinated in 2001. Five years later, he was legally elected as the President on the first free democratic election of the country. Later on, he was re-elected on 2011, being his second and last presidency term. By ‘proposing’ these changes to the electoral code, the next presidential elections should be delayed and his term should be lengthened. The population was displeased as the Senate was already studying the proposition. Four days of violent protests followed on mid January 2015 and numerous clashes between the security forces and the demonstrators occured, leaving a total of 40 people killed by the security forces. Eventually, the Senate pushed over the proposition and voted ‘unanimously’ to remove any procedure to change the electoral code which allow the elections to take place as expected in 2016.

				Toronto, the biggest city of Canada hosted in 2010 the G20 conference. As usual, many protesters went to the streets with the hope of being heard by the twenty most powerful countries of the world. The Toronto police department had consequently prepared itself to prevent any threats towards the event. They installed a fence surrounding G20 conference site and required the identification of anyone near the fence.  the identification to anyone near the fence. On June 26th 2010, the protesters were peacefully chanting slogans for change, expressing their opinions; among them people from other countries that came to have their word heard. Later on that evening, a group of people clothed on black created violence and chaos. These people, called the ‘Black Block’ broke Show cases, torched vehicles, etc... They ended their disastrous course at the Queen Elizabeth Park where they took off their black clothes and anonymously mixed with the rest of the crowd. Meanwhile,  police officers started massive arrest of  demonstrators by circling little groups and violently grabbing one person at the time. The police also used rubber bullets, smoke bombs, as they were riding horses and bicycles to contain the masses. Even when the protesters only sat down peacefully, the officers arrested them using force.  
				The great number of people arrested was brought to the old Toronto Film Studios which became a  ‘makeshift prison’. 
				According to the testimonies taken after almost a day of imprisonment, the demonstrators arrested weren’t allowed to call anyone, they had little water and food, they were put in small cages and segregation was made depending on their sexual orientation. There were also cases of sexual assault during the arrest of some women.
 				Fortunately, enough information was released and many of the injustices have been punished.
				Still, it is very concerning to see this happening in a country as Canada.

			Mexico, September 2014, many were found dead after a clash between the police of Iguala and the students of Raúl Isidro Burgos school. The students were heading from Ayotzinapa, Guerrero to Iguala where a demonstration was going to be held. On their way, police officers intercepted the 5 buses and arrested all the persons in 2 of the buses from where the 43 students were reported missing. They shot as well another bus  killing many of the students. To this day, The forty-three students arrested have not been found.
			Divers demonstrations have been held in many states of the country, and many universities have been active to press the government to research for the 43 missing students. Although during these protests there wasn’t any violence from the authorities, the investigation has proved that the Iguala mayor, José Luis Abarca Velázquez, ordered the attacks and arrests, and handed the students to a narco gang called the ‘Guerreros Unidos’. The leader of the gang was captured and declared that they tortured, killed and dumped the bodies in a mass grave. Months later, the authorities found 43 bodies which were calcined. The Mexican authorities claimed that those were the bodies of the 43 missing students but the UN investigators said that the analysis proved that none of the bodies were from the 43 Ayotzinapa students. The bodies were probably from any other disappearance which happens all over the country.  
			The demonstrations continued to press the President, Enrique Peña Nieto to step down and to leave the presidential post to another person. The protests didn’t work and the 43 students are still missing to this day.

			Even if there’s still a long way to go and there are still numerous countries that may not respect the right of expression, in some countries as Guatemala, the demonstrations worked just right. In a country that suffered great oppression during the civil war (1960-1996) where at least 245 000 people disappeared or died,  and that still encoures various social problems, many voices risen up in 2015 demanding the resignation of the President, Otto Pérez Molina, after the exposure of a multimillion-dollar corruption scandal. To accomplish this, they organised a demonstration every Saturday for nearly two months where thousands of protesters assembled to stop corruption. The crowd gathered everyone: students, workers, businessmen, priests, house makers, etc. and the trial was supervised by the UN since the judicial system in Guatemala is too weak. 
			Finally, the president resigned and all ended without any casualties or injustices of any type.

			Violence, injustice, corruption, war, deaths, V.S. chants, crowds, voices. How frequently do we need to hear this on the news? How many times do we need to see violence? When are we going to realize that WE have the power to change something? We are the people, we are the ones who give power to the ones who oppress us. We aren’t puppets or expectators of our lives. We are the leaders, the actors.  “The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; [...]”, and to kill, to oppress, to dictate, should not be the basis of tour authority’s actions. The authority should protect us and our will. Here I spoke about only few cases when there are countless other (...) because I want to change something and here is my opinion. What about yours?
